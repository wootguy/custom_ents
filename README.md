# weapon_custom

weapon_custom is a collection of entities used to create new and improved weapons in Sven Co-op. The goal of the project is to allow mappers with no scripting experience to make cool new weapons, or just tweak the existing ones. There are 9 entities, 34 flags, and 356 keyvalues to learn, so you may want to start with a tutorial or just experiment with the example map.
